    <h1 class="page-title">About FOGGS</h1>
    <p class="lede">Established in Brussels in 2013, the Foundation for Global Governance and Sustainability (FOGGS) is a think-and-do tank that blends research, dialogue, and advocacy for future-ready multilateralism.</p>

    <section class="section" aria-label="Origins and focus">
      <h2>Our origins and focus</h2>
      <p>FOGGS is a Public Benefit Foundation under Belgian law, governed by statutes modified in 2018, 2020, and 2021. It operates as a research and ideas-generation centre, discussion forum, and advocacy mechanism.</p>
      <p>The founders were inspired by the UN Secretary-General’s High-Level Panel on Global Sustainability (2010–2012), which helped introduce the concept of Sustainable Development Goals. The original aspiration was to continue that work, including the sensitive economic dimension. In 2018, FOGGS refocused on building a new “Grand Narrative” for globalisation.</p>
      <p>You can find a non-exhaustive presentation of what FOGGS does here.</p>
