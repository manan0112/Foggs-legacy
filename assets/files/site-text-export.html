  <p><strong>Our origins and focus</strong></p>
  <p>Established in Brussels in 2013, the Foundation for Global Governance and Sustainability (FOGGS) is a think-and-do tank, serving as a research and ideas-generation centre, discussion forum, and advocacy mechanism. FOGGS is a Public Benefit Foundation under Belgian law and is governed by its statutes, as modified in 2018, 2020, and 2021.</p>
  <p>The founders were inspired by the UN Secretary-General's High-Level Panel on Global Sustainability (2010–2012), which helped introduce the concept of Sustainable Development Goals. The initial aspiration was to continue the Panel's work, including on the economy. In 2018 the work of FOGGS refocused on developing a new "Grand Narrative" for globalisation.</p>

  <p>About FOGGS</p>
  <p>Established in Brussels in 2013, the Foundation for Global Governance and Sustainability (FOGGS) is a think-and-do tank that blends research, dialogue, and advocacy for future-ready multilateralism.</p>
  <p><strong>Our origins and focus</strong></p>
  <p>FOGGS is a Public Benefit Foundation under Belgian law, governed by statutes modified in 2018, 2020, and 2021. It operates as a research and ideas-generation centre, discussion forum, and advocacy mechanism.</p>
  <p>The founders were inspired by the UN Secretary-General's High-Level Panel on Global Sustainability (2010–2012), which helped introduce the concept of Sustainable Development Goals. The original aspiration was to continue that work, including the sensitive economic dimension. In 2018, FOGGS refocused on building a new "Grand Narrative" for globalisation.</p>
